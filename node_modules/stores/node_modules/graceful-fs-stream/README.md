> Graceful filesystem streams.

Provides both readable and writable filesystem streams that open the file on **first read or write**.

Because stream producers are not always stream consumers, it can be useful to create a stream without worrying if data
has ever been read or written.
It lazy opens or creates files. So it ensures a loose coupling between stream creation and file opening or creation.
This can be useful in various use case where you can to create streams without accessing the file system yet.

## Installation

```bash
npm install graceful-fs-stream --production
```

## Usage

```javascript
var fs = require('graceful-fs-stream');

/** read stream */

var readable = fs.createReadStream(file);
// file is no yet open
readable.once('data', function() {
	// file was just open
});

/** write stream */

var writable = fs.createWriteStream(path);
// file is not yet open
writable.write('hey');
// file was just open
```

Note that if you try to close a stream directly, it won't crash badly.
